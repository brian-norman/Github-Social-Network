Is there any special reason for storing multiple BehaviorDelegates though? The DrawerBehavior class is instantiated for each view that sets the behavior programmatically or by XML, so why assume there's multiple views with delegates?

Pre-dates open sourcing when it was being used for multiple views at once. The assumption can be removed.

When the drawer state is idle (ViewDragHelper.STATE_IDLE), I'm checking if onScreen is less than 1 but not 0. I noticed that it was 0.1 when it was persisting.

Although I'm not sure if this is the right way to fix this, it seems to work. The peek is kind of dismissed.

Before closing the drawer we must check if the drawer is in lock mode but this feature is not yet implemented.

However your claim is correct in the end, but the relevant doc here is [AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.annotation/-annotation-retention/-r-u-n-t-i-m-e.html) and the [annotation design doc](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/spec-docs/annotation-options.md#retention),2020-04-03T00:04:46Z,2020-04-03T00:05:23Z608339043,592978529,PhilGlass,@TWiStErRob You're right, that's the wrong documentation link.

After all necessary changes to make project compile I got runtime crash.

The issue is that [**HomeActivity**](https://github.com/android/plaid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/ui/HomeActivity.kt) should be injected by [**HomeComponent**](https://github.com/android/plaid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/dagger/HomeComponent.kt). The issue is that **HomeComponent** doesn't declare the inject method directly but rather implements generic injector interface [**BaseActivityComponent**](https://github.com/android/plaid/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/core/dagger/BaseComponent.kt).  Which implements [**BaseComponent**](https://github.com/android/plaid/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/core/dagger/BaseComponent.kt) that has generic method 
```
fun inject(target: T)
```

During debug, I see that reflection is looking to parameter type of the method declaration which is resoled to **Object**  rather than taking the type of the passed parameter **HomeActivity**.

I wonder what are you thoughts about the issue and the approach taken in the plaid app?,2020-03-18T11:01:43Z,2020-03-24T14:10:29Z603261322,583645852,JakeWharton,The support of generics is lacking.

interface SubFeatureComponentA {

(sometimes also FeatureComponent has some modules defined, but it's irrelevant in this case)

`getChannel()` returns `NotificationChannel` object that is available from API 26.

```kotlin

public interface ExampleActivityModule {

    @ContributesAndroidInjector
    ExampleFragment fragment();
}
```

the latest branch is this one https://github.com/kokeroulis/dagger-reflect/commits/atsiap/module_with_generic_try_to_add_workaround_new_fixes

The "workarounds" that are included there might not work for every case, this is why they are just left there instead of opening a PR here but the project in which i am using them is quite big and complicated, so they might be useful for you...

I will upload another branch in a few days which will include fixes for the `@IntoMap`.. In the above branch there are cases in which the `@IntoMap` doesn't work...,2020-03-19T17:55:12Z,2020-03-19T17:55:12Z491003061,491003061,matejdro,When doing android injection the verbose way (without `ContributesAndroidInjection`), calling `AndroidInjection.inject()` will not actually do anything (fields will not be injected).

This is after applying workaround for the https://github.com/JakeWharton/dagger-reflect/issues/170.

Sample code:

```kotlin
@Singleton
@Component(
    modules = [
        AppModule::class,
        TextModule::class
    ]
)
interface AppComponent {
    fun inject(app: MyApp)
}

@Module(
    subcomponents = [MainActivitySubcomponent::class]
)
interface AppModule {
    @Binds
    @IntoMap
    @ClassKey(MainActivity::class)
    fun bindMainActivityInjectorFactory(
        factory: MainActivitySubcomponent.Factory
    ): AndroidInjector.Factory<*>
}

@Module
object TextModule {
    @Provides
    @JvmStatic
    fun provideString() = "Test"

    // Inject empty string map as a workaround for
    // https://github.com/JakeWharton/dagger-reflect/issues/170
    @Provides
    @JvmStatic
    fun provideEmptyStringMap()
            : Map<@JvmSuppressWildcards String, @JvmSuppressWildcards Provider<AndroidInjector.Factory<*>>> =
        emptyMap()
}

@Subcomponent
interface MainActivitySubcomponent : AndroidInjector<MainActivity> {
    @Subcomponent.Factory
    interface Factory : AndroidInjector.Factory<MainActivity>
}


class MyApp : Application(), HasAndroidInjector {
    @Inject
    lateinit var androidInjector: DispatchingAndroidInjector<Any>

    override fun onCreate() {
        Dagger
            .create(AppComponent::class.java)
            .inject(this)

        super.onCreate()
    }

    override fun androidInjector(): AndroidInjector<Any> = androidInjector
}

class MainActivity : Activity() {
    @Inject
    lateinit var injectedString: String

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        AndroidInjection.inject(this)
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        Log.d("MainActivity", "Injected string: $injectedString")
    }
}
```

Above code is supposed to print `Injected string: Test` into logcat when activity starts, but instead it crashes with `lateinit property injectedString has not been initialized` since injection was not performed.

Running this with normal annotation processing dagger works fine.

Running this with normal annotation processing dagger works fine.,2019-09-09T07:54:54Z,2019-09-09T10:08:13Z529348142,490936608,matejdro,I think the issue is that `dagger-inject` ignores `@Multibinds` annotation in `dagger.android.AndroidInjectionModule`

Workaround for the issue is to manually inject empty map:

```kotlin
    @Provides
    @JvmStatic
    fun provideEmptyStringMap()
            : Map<@JvmSuppressWildcards String, @JvmSuppressWildcards Provider<AndroidInjector.Factory<*>>> =
        emptyMap()
```,2019-09-09T08:07:31Z,2019-09-09T10:08:13Z477841813,477841813,amatkovsky,Consider the following code:
```
class ThingImpl extends Thing<String, Integer> {}

abstract class Thing<V, T> {
    @Inject Provider<V> vProvider;

    @Inject Provider<T> tProvider;

    @Inject V value;

    @Inject T t;
  }

...
component.inject(thingImpl);
...

```
When `ReflectiveMembersInjector` goes through the `@Inject`-annotated fields it tries to look
`V` and `T` bindings. Obviously, there are no such bindings since the actual bindings provide a `String` and an `Integer`. This leads to an error: `IllegalArgumentException: No provider available for V`.

See related pr with a test case: https://github.com/JakeWharton/dagger-reflect/pull/167,2019-08-07T10:25:54Z,2019-08-07T10:26:30Z477837767,477837767,amatkovsky,This pr adds a test to cover the case when there are @Inject annotated fields with type parameters. Real world example: a class `BaseFragment<P extends Presenter>` with a field `P presenter`.
The fix included is just an ad-hoc solution to highlight the issue and help come up with proper fix.,2019-08-07T10:17:54Z,2019-08-07T10:32:48Z519036779,477837767,runningcode,Is this a duplicate of this? https://github.com/JakeWharton/dagger-reflect/pull/129,2019-08-07T10:20:54Z,2019-08-07T10:20:54Z519040339,477837767,amatkovsky,> Is this a duplicate of this? #129

I am not sure. It looks like your pr deals with generics when resolving jit bindings while this pr is about resolving bindings for the fields.
But I think your solution may be expanded to cover this case too.,2019-08-07T10:32:48Z,2019-08-07T10:32:48Z477148865,477148865,JakeWharton,Right now it's paid at invoke-time. Seems like we should do this once during linking rather than for each binding invocation.,2019-08-06T03:21:44Z,2019-08-06T03:21:44Z476460086,476460086,TWiStErRob,Fix 3 TODOs and cover them with tests. Note: I missed `mapOfLazyKey` deliberately, see #159.

This only works if the nullability annotations have runtime retention.

I feel like it would add a good bit of runtime overhead to create one for each DepenencyRequest.,2019-07-21T19:29:33Z,2019-07-21T19:31:31Z470042981,470042981,Laimiux,Added a test + implementation for the following use case:
```java
// Generic builder interface
interface ComponentBuilder<Component> {
  Component build()

@Component
interface MyComponent {
  @Component.Builder
  interface MyBuilder extends ComponentBuilder<Component> {

One of the issues I ran into is that `abstract ParentModule` is extended by two modules and the non-parameterized method bindings are added twice throwing IllegalStateException.,2019-07-18T23:01:29Z,2019-08-05T17:24:43Z469459790,469459790,Laimiux,By default, dagger-compiler generates a default `Builder` class.  

With setup such as this:
```kotlin
interface Host {
  fun myDependency(): MyDependency
}

@Component(dependencies = [Host::class])
interface MyFeatureComponent {
  fun feature(): MyFeature
}
```

there will be a generated method
```kotlin
DaggerMyFeatureComponent.builder().dependencies(myDependencies).build()
```

```groovy

My setup is roughly like this:

```
@Component(modules = [ FooModule::class ])
interface MyComponent { ... }

@Module
class FooModule(private val myInjectedActivity: BaseInjectedActivity) { ... }

abstract class BaseInjectedActivty {

To replicate the issue:
1. I've replaced `proguard-rules.pro` with the new rules in this PR

1. In the current state applying the proguard rules, DaggerAppCompnent is not kept:

2. The rule looks correct, but doesn't keep:

```proguard
-whyareyoukeeping class com.example.AppComponent
-whyareyoukeeping class com.example.DaggerAppComponent
```

```properties
android.enableR8=true

com.example.AppComponent
|- is referenced in keep rule:
|  <PROGUARD_COMPATIBILITY_RULE>:Unknown
Nothing is keeping com.example.DaggerAppComponent
```

```properties
android.enableR8=true
android.enableR8.fullMode=true

Nothing is keeping com.example.AppComponent
Nothing is keeping com.example.DaggerAppComponent
```

```properties
android.enableR8=false

com.example.AppComponent
  is invoked by    com.example.DaggerAppComponent.create (32:32)
  is kept by a directive in the configuration.

com.example.DaggerAppComponent
  is kept by a directive in the configuration.

# but still crashes with java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.example.Daggera"
```

3. Manually adding the rules, everything works with all variants of shrinking:
```proguard
-keepnames class com.example.AppComponent
-keep class com.example.DaggerAppComponent {
  static ** create();
}
```

4.

For example given that we have the following module 

```
@Module
public abstract class BaseActivityBindingModule<T extends Activity> {

I'm not sure there's a whole lot we can do here except for caching nothing which will destroy what little performance choices we've made. My best guess is you changed the shape of a class where we already cached its information via reflection. Using these reflective objects after the change causes ART to crash with a nasty error which, if they want to keep crashing, should probably have something a bit more user-friendly.,2019-07-05T21:41:20Z,2019-07-05T21:41:20Z571951005,464232896,PaulWoitaschek,Filed https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/147310999,2020-01-08T08:53:00Z,2020-01-08T08:53:00Z571961064,464232896,acleung,@JakeWharton: What's getting cached by Dagger? j/l/Class, j/l/reflect/Field,Method ?,2020-01-08T09:20:22Z,2020-01-08T09:20:31Z572162872,464232896,JakeWharton,Probably all three. Keys in the core map contain references to `Class`es and the associated map values contain references to `Method`s or `Field`s. Unfortunately it's somewhat fundamental to how the library works.,2020-01-08T17:02:38Z,2020-01-08T17:02:38Z572318832,464232896,allight,This is caused by an oversight in the class-redefinition functionality underlying "apply changes" leading j.l.r.Field objects to become invalid. There's not really anything one would be able to do at this level to work around or avoid this bug unfortunately. 

Until it's fixed in the platform or worked-around in apply-changes I'm not sure there's anything to do except avoid apply-changes on code using this.,2020-01-09T00:10:05Z,2020-01-09T00:10:05Z572355790,464232896,acleung,@JakeWharton: Is there a way to turn off caching of reflection objects for development builds? Given that Apply Changes only works on Debug builds and developers are probably more interested in rapid compile and deploy cycles than in-app performance at this point. Turning that off in Debug builds can be a workaround for those who are using older version of Android.,2020-01-09T02:40:08Z,2020-01-09T02:40:08Z572767652,464232896,JakeWharton,The entry point to the library is a user supplying instances of a `Class` so to some degree it's impossible for the core functionality to work without retaining some of these references.

Will that workaround be implemented in dagger reflect?,2020-01-25T13:58:27Z,2020-01-25T13:58:27Z462907569,462907569,runningcode,Dont allow type variables in keys.,2019-07-01T20:55:36Z,2019-08-06T13:16:02Z408354560,408354560,TWiStErRob,Measurement: `gradlew clean check`
Current `master`: 16s (https://scans.gradle.com/s/im3x27mkieat6)
Gradle parallel: 10s (https://scans.gradle.com/s/xbixn2tzo6va4)

I like playing with builds, so I tried to go further:
Move APT classes to modules: 7s (https://scans.gradle.com/s/vutaiobangdts)
Move IntegrationTest next to classes: 6s (https://scans.gradle.com/s/5wiwkyulfkuy2)

The last two steps are not included in this PR, but the commits are here:
https://github.com/TWiStErRob/dagger-reflect/commits/abandoned/parallel
if you think it would be useful, happy to clean it up and raise a PR

Mind you I have a brand new PC with 14 cores, dagger-reflect builds use 4-8 cores only, so YMMV significantly.

Also tried https://guides.gradle.org/performance/#parallel_test_execution, but makes no difference with current amount of tests, compilation is the slowest.

Also tried `-Adagger.formatGeneratedSource=disabled` but makes no difference,2019-02-08T22:51:02Z,2019-08-05T17:24:42Z462007621,408354560,JakeWharton,So we can't check this in because it allows the `uploadArchives` task to run in parallel. Sonatype, the target for the artifacts, sees concurrent uploads as separate and creates two separate staging repositories. This will break the snapshot and release builds as a result. Those tasks need restricted to run serially before something like this can be merged.,2019-02-09T03:01:12Z,2019-02-09T03:01:12Z462011423,408354560,TWiStErRob,Do you mean something like this?
```kotlin
val uploads = allprojects.mapNotNull { it.tasks.uploadArchives }
uploads.zip(uploads.skip(1)) { task1, task2 -> task1.mustRunAfter(task2) }
```
but Groovy and hopefully using lazy task getters :)

Didn't want to go straight for adding `-Werror`, because it may clobber local hacking; but I think on CI the commands should include `-Pstrict.compilation=true`.,2019-02-08T22:50:37Z,2019-08-07T09:28:04Z462014640,408354475,JakeWharton,I've merged e62ad1ba6ef3c6dc52350c95dab10cba84a367f8 and 4f75adaf65d222dabe3c010ee7566dca7f3994be. I'm still thinking about the others. I think bf2 might be obsoleted by a change I'm about to make to bindings and I need to think about 0c4 more.

Sometimes, it's 3 of that chars, or sometimes it's 2 only, most of the time, there are none of them. It's totally random.

These unknown characters pushes the border out of sync for that particular line.

System.out.println(FlipTable.of(headers, data));

scenario isn’t totally far fetched because it’s fairly common for 
Android developers to place their disk caches in the Android application 
cache directory. The cache directory can be cleared at any time by the 
system, including while the app is open, which in turn can cause 
unexpected IOExceptions when ``delete()`` is called.

I set a max of 256MB but the cache grows up to more than 450MB. That's because each small file takes at least 4kb in disk. Since this is a disk cache I would assume that setting a max would take block size in consideration.

```
 * <p>This cache limits the number of bytes that it will store on the
 * filesystem. When the number of stored bytes exceeds the limit, the cache will
 * remove entries in the background until the limit is satisfied. The limit is
 * not strict: the cache may temporarily exceed it while waiting for files to be
 * deleted. The limit does not include filesystem overhead or the cache
 * journal so space-sensitive applications should set a conservative limit

I use DiskLruCache in a multi-thread environment. I get an infinite loop in the trimToSize method: 

while (size > maxSize) {
      Map.Entry<String, Entry> toEvict = lruEntries.entrySet().iterator().next();
      remove(toEvict.getKey());
}

The remove call fails to remove the entry, as an other thread is editing the toEvict entry. Shouldn't we check if the remove worked, and for example silently return if it did not ?

I think it's going to run faster as a single loop that runs until the size is sufficiently small, or there's nothing left to remove. (Since we only allocate one iterator). Even better if you can fast-fail at the front and avoid allocating the iterator at all if the cache is already sufficiently small.

In most cases, it shouldn't be a problem. But when I need to cache a lot of small images with DiskLruCache, it brings this issue to me.

Hence, I would like to know if it's possible to create the sub-directory within DiskLruCache's cahce directory so we can solve this issue for good.

DiskLruCache.Editor editor = getDiskCache().edit(key);
try {
    File file = editor.getFile(0);
    new FileOutputStream(file).write(data);
    editor.commit();
} finally {
    editor.abortUnlessCommitted();
}
```

Now, `commit` calls `completeEdit` which has a line `dirty.renameTo(clean);`
[`File.renameTo`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/File.html#renameTo%28java.io.File%29) has a return value which is discarded. This may fail **silently** due to a clumsy way of writing the file (as seen above) and think that the commit was commited. However later when `getDiskCache.get(key)` is called it sees that the file is missing [for the wrong reason](https://github.com/JakeWharton/DiskLruCache/blob/master/src/main/java/com/jakewharton/disklrucache/DiskLruCache.java#L426).

The reason for `renameTo` failing is because there still a handle open for it in the process and the OS (Windows) may prevent the rename and return `false`. (side note: the strange thing is that in the past I've been able to rename running/and-locked .exe files without any problems from non-Java apps)

The line was mentioned in #67 where if you check the return value the operation will be still atomic and should throw an `IOException` as you do in https://github.com/JakeWharton/DiskLruCache/commit/4c31913192eae6ae6bf8a239e89844a0ab2455e7 which is a fix for #32.

Also there are other 3 `File.delete` calls which are not checked, mostly related to backup files but still worth checking the code (and intentionally ignoring it with a comment maybe).

We can't wait for the previous file to be closed (that could take forever) and we can't delete it either.

The missing checks are still missing though, and I can't `package` DiskLruCache which probably won't be fixed even after the checks are there...

With the above file you sent I did the following (I'm not sure this is what you wanted):
- clone this repo and replace `DiskLruCache.java`
- comment out test that are not compiling (anything using `journalBkpFile` and `setMaxSize`)
- comment out assertions that are not compiling (`snapshot.getLength`)
- add `@Test(timeout=10000)` to some tests because they're just spinning (`while (true)`)<br>
  `rebuildJournalOnRepeatedReads` created a 14MB journal in 5 minutes, then I killed the java process

The output is very similar to what I've quoted above.

as @swankjesse said:

> The Windows file system model pretty much breaks DiskLruCache completely.

Probably there's nothing much to do, except maybe adding the checks to have better error reporting if anything breaks randomly on Android/Unix (we can't expect `.delete()` and `.renameTo()` to return true all the time I guess). Same stands for the `timeout=` for those tests, they don't have a failure condition, they either pass or run forever.

For example in our application we detect if the device hits an exception due to being very low on disk space, and if it is we reduce the size of our disk cache and immediately tell it to discard some files. Doing that our application will be functional until there is no more space to release from our internal directories.

I've created an object cache that wraps the DiskLruCache.  Here are my put and get methods:

```
public Object get(String key) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        Object result = null;
        String sanitizedKey = getDiskHashKey(key);
        if(cache != null){
            DiskLruCache.Snapshot snapshot = cache.get(sanitizedKey);
            if (snapshot != null) {
                InputStream inputStream = snapshot.getInputStream(0);
                InputStream buffer = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);
                ObjectInput input = new ObjectInputStream(buffer);
                result = input.readObject();
                snapshot.close();
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

public void put(String key, Object value) throws IOException {
        String sanitizedKey = getDiskHashKey(key);
        DiskLruCache.Editor creator = cache.edit(sanitizedKey);
        if(creator != null){
            try{
                ObjectOutputStream objOutStream = new ObjectOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(creator.newOutputStream(0)));
                objOutStream.writeObject(value);
                objOutStream.close();
                creator.commit();
            }catch(Exception e){
                e.printStackTrace();
                creator.abort();
            }
        }
    }
```

My caches are on the order of 3,000 objects when i start seeing the behavior.  This object cache is accessed by multiple threads but it looks to me like the DiskLruCache itself is doing the necessary synchronization.  I've seen the cache get wiped out several times, and I've managed to capture a cache in the state where it has an invalid entry:

READ 2013-reg-c8d10fe6-8c07-4b33-8d03-b7addf69038d
READ 2013-reg-191ff930-47e3-48b0-92f2-1da067e982d4
READ 2013-reg-b6ff7fd9-7da5-4f71-946f-e5d560060794
RREAD 2013-pst-72fe30af-b568-48cd-8582-bfbaa0e2ae6b

READ 2013-pst-0117fbeb-a140-43ba-8dd2-4b7fc0f55211

In every case where the cache has become corrupted, the behavior is similar.  Part of a READ entry is written over with another READ.  This isn't at the very end of the cache state, its about 85% of the way through the cache.

```
  @Test public void openWithTruncatedLineDiscardsThatLine() throws Exception {
    cache.close();
    writeFile(getCleanFile("k1", 0), "A");
    writeFile(getCleanFile("k1", 1), "B");
    Writer writer = new FileWriter(journalFile);
    writer.write(MAGIC + "\n" + VERSION_1 + "\n100\n2\n\nCLEAN k1 1 1"); // no trailing newline
    writer.close();
    cache = DiskLruCache.open(cacheDir, appVersion, 2, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    assertThat(cache.get("k1")).isNull();
  }
```

I suspect the problem is that we recover from the incomplete journal, but we don't delete the truncated line before starting to write new lines into the file?

I suppose this is because a cache of unknown state is not super useful, but in my use case, im not sure how to avoid this scenario.
,2014-01-16T22:34:20Z,2014-01-16T22:34:20Z60210840,25756099,rupertbates,I'm seeing a variation on this issue which is happening on Android. The behaviour is the same in that there is a corrupted line in the journal and that is causing the cache to be deleted on opening. In my case the line looks like this:

READ 96644ef5b41c75bd081e1737bREAD e9211ead93e7e0c88e4f79b0d5af4a45
Ie. it has 2 keys on the line. 

This causes the method readJournalLine() to throw when it encounters it at which point the whole cache gets deleted. It would be much more use to me to just drop the invalid line rather than deleting the whole cache (particularly if it is just a read that is corrupted), can anyone see any reason why this wouldn't work?

}

this happens quite rarely (seen it for the first time after several months, with 200 people using my app), and I have no indication what may cause it. No comments, no exception message.

,2013-05-09T18:42:26Z,2013-05-09T18:42:26Z12150565,12150565,jwoolston,We use this cache to store images and allow the user to adjust the cache size. If there is a sufficiently large difference in current storage vs. new cache size, then the cache is at least partially reduced imediately. However when there is a difference which does not match the requirements of half of the journal size or 2000 ops, then it seems the size will not be adjusted. It would be nice to have a call like DiskLruCache.setMaxSizeImmediate(size) or just a flag on whether it should be immediately enforced.
,2013-03-18T19:47:05Z,2013-03-18T19:47:05Z7028532,7028532,swankjesse,We're using DiskLruCache in a serverside app that downloads images from a remote server. When two requests simultaneously want to store the same image in the cache, the code gets very ugly very fast. The problem is that edit() returns null and we have no mechanism to wait on the other editor's download to complete.

It would be handy if there was an API to await a snapshot that's currently being created.

I think it would be relatively straightforward to implement this on top of Guava's LoadingCache, but it would be simpler code to just do the blocking mechanics directly in DiskLruCache.
,2012-09-20T23:55:05Z,2015-05-02T15:49:41Z11438860,7028532,chrisbanes,The way I've implemented this is to keep a Map of ReentrantLocks. Feels a bit hacky but it seems to be working.

``` java
HashMap<String, ReentrantLock> mDiskCacheEditLocks = new HashMap<String, ReentrantLock>();

final ReentrantLock lock = getLockForDiskCacheEdit(key);
lock.lock();
try {
    DiskLruCache.Editor editor = mDiskCache.edit(key);
    // blah
    editor.commit();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}

private ReentrantLock getLockForDiskCacheEdit(String key) {
    synchronized (mDiskCacheEditLocks) {
        ReentrantLock lock = mDiskCacheEditLocks.get(key);
        if (null == lock) {
            lock = new ReentrantLock();
            mDiskCacheEditLocks.put(key, lock);
        }
        return lock;
    }
}

I check the journal file and found that: the new cache you just created is marked with "DIRTY", and even if I called commit, there's no "CLEAN" followed that "DIRTY", at this time, if the app crashes, the cache leaves "DIRTY" but not "CLEAN" which it should be. Then you launch the app again, the "DIRTY" cache with no "CLEAN" followed will be deleted, and you lost the cache.

This scenario cannot covered by android test cases.

I found this may be caused by the journal is opened by BufferedWriter which has a 8K buffer internally. So the latest "CLEAN" state is actually in the buffer but not in disk when the crash happens.

Add the following line in completeEdit method seems can solve this:
journalWriter.flush();
,2012-09-18T14:13:05Z,2013-08-20T11:30:08Z8659000,6953889,swankjesse,This is a policy decision in the API. You can manually call flush() in your own code if you'd like to flush the journal after every write. DiskLruCache doesn't do this by default because it wants to minimize the number of slow disk writes it makes.
,2012-09-18T15:35:25Z,2012-09-18T15:35:25Z8659006,6953889,swankjesse,That said, this does need to be documented!

Back to my case, my app is an android app which may be closed or interrupted unpredictably, and I has only one chance to create a cache(after a video is downloaded) and use it elsewhere. If someone has the similar case with me, I suggest flush after every commit immediately.

The tab strip is being reduced in size and I have not found any way to increase the size back to normal.  Other devices like Nexus 5x (also on Android 7.0) does not see this issue.  And we haven't had this issue with previous versions of Android.

I haven't been able to find search results that might help me do a work around for this (either by resetting the tab strip to the correct height, or being able to determine when this condition might exist so maybe I could reduce the size of the images if needed).  I'm looking for any help I can get on this since our client is making this an urgent issue.  The first image I'm attaching is the way it's being displayed on these certain devices, and the second image is how it should be looking.

I had to add a small paddingBottom (15dp) to the tabs button image view which decreased the size of the image on these affected devices.  It also seemed that even with the paddingBottom being applied, the non-affected devices really had no size differences of the button images on them.  So at least this worked for now.

            android.R.id.home : R.id.abs__home);
    ((View) homeIcon.getParent()).setVisibility(View.GONE);
    ((View) homeIcon).setVisibility(View.GONE);
}

actionBar.setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(false);
actionBar.setDisplayShowTitleEnabled(false);

View actionbar = LayoutInflater.from(this).inflate(R.layout.custom_title_bar, null);
getSupportActionBar().setCustomView(actionbar);
actionBar.setDisplayShowCustomEnabled(true);
```

}
but here now ActionBar title is looking like below, see there is left black area so I am looking to remove this with my color so my question Is there any way to remove that black area ?

custom_title_bar.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/relativeLayout1"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:background="@drawable/header_smartpay"
    android:orientation="horizontal" >

</RelativeLayout>

Below Android 3.0, I am having that issue but that is working perfectly above Android OS 3.0.

actionBar.setLogo(new ColorDrawable(Color.TRANSPARENT));

```
      View homeIcon = findViewById(
                Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB ? 
                android.R.id.home : R.id.abs__home);
        ((View) homeIcon.getParent()).setLayoutParams(new  LinearLayout.LayoutParams(0, 0));
        ((View) homeIcon).setVisibility(View.GONE);
```

if i do use inbuilt single textview as layout (android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1), it works great, one line set of suggestion will appear and it scrolls well.

but if i use my own custom i.e "com.test.task.R.layout.layout_task_item", it covers full screen and overlaps keyboard.

@Override
    public View newView(Context context, Cursor cursor, ViewGroup parent) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
         LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(context);
       //  View v = inflater.inflate(com.test.task.R.layout.layout_task_item, parent, false);
         View v = inflater.inflate(android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, parent, false);

```
     return v;
}
```

Hi,

I'm using the actionbarsherlock searchview, if i type a text in suggestion view i get set of results in dropdown, but if i scroll the suggestions, the entire suggestion view overlaps on my keyboard. How to prevent this

Here how the image looks

![results](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7241764/3118125/7bb169f0-e738-11e3-8569-d0227be69238.png)

The code i'm using for creating searchview is 

Menu.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" >  
 <item android:id="@+id/search"
      android:title="@string/ManageList"
      android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"
      android:showAsAction="collapseActionView|always" 
      android:actionViewClass="com.actionbarsherlock.widget.SearchView"/>
</menu>

This is how i'm crating menu in my activity.

 MenuInflater inflater = this.getSupportMenuInflater();
            inflater.inflate(R.menu.menu_home_activity, menu);

```
        mSearchview = (SearchView) menu.findItem(R.id.search).getActionView();
        mSearchview.setImeOptions(EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_DONE);

        mSearchview.setFocusable(true);
        mSearchview.requestFocusFromTouch();

        if(mSearchadapter == null)
        {
            mSearchadapter = new SearchAdapter(getApplication(), null);
        }

        mSearchview.setSuggestionsAdapter(mSearchadapter);

        mSearchview.setOnQueryTextListener(new OnQueryTextListener() {

            @Override
            public boolean onQueryTextSubmit(String query) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return false;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean onQueryTextChange(String newText) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
               if(newText.trim().equals(""))
               {
                   return false;
               }

               Cursor c = TaskController.getDBManager().getAllTasksForSuggestedFilter(newText);

               mSearchadapter.changeCursor(c);

               return false;
            }
        });

**_Reproduction**_

```
public class Main extends SherlockActivity {
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_INDETERMINATE_PROGRESS);
    setContentView(R.layout.test);

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_INDETERMINATE_PROGRESS);
    setSupportProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(false); // or true if you want the spinner to be visible by default
    setContentView(R.layout.test);

I tried cleaning the project and some other things but the bug keeps appearing. I'm using one library project with some Activity's. And 4 other projects use this library.

Important thing to notice is that the app works fine on the emulator. I'm also using proguard.

I found some topics covering this crash but no working solutions.

I am in great need of you as i am stuck in this issue from the last 4 days.

So,here is the thing....

I have one sherlock fragment activity from which i calling the six fragments inside viewpager.

Now i want to manipulate the sherlock action bar depends on the selected tab.

So for the first 3 tab i want to show the searchview and overflow menu icon.

For that what i have tried so far ::

1) Called the setHasOptionsMenu(true); in every fragment.
2) Added the onCreateOptionsMenu() in every fragment. and

then i have achieved what i want.

Now i want that onClick of the searchview it should get expanded and collapse when pressed the back. So to achieve that i have added this in my first 3 fragment and also implement the puru's logic .(Create the onPrepareOptionMenu() in every fragment and add the onQueryTextChange(""); method).

```
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) 
{
   super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
   getActivity().supportInvalidateOptionsMenu();
   setHasOptionsMenu(true);
}
```

Fragment Code :: 

```
@Override
public void onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu, MenuInflater inflater) 
{
    super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu, inflater);

    inflater.inflate(R.menu.menu, menu);
    MenuItem searchItem = menu.findItem(R.id.menu_item_search);
    SearchView searchView = (SearchView) searchItem.getActionView();
    searchView.setQueryHint("Search for Products");
    searchView.setOnQueryTextListener(this);
    searchView.setIconifiedByDefault(false);
   }
@Override
 public void onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu menu) 
 {
    super.onPrepareOptionsMenu(menu);
    onQueryTextChange("");
 }
  @Override

 {
    return true;

Problem :: (on Pre-HoneyComb Device)

Now when i click of the first fragment's searchview,it not get expanded,but works well for fragment 2 and fragment 3.

Steps ::

1)go to directly fragment 1,click on searchview,not expanding
2)go to directly on fragment 2 tab(not clicking onsearchview in second fragment),back to fragment 1,searchview expanding
3)go to directly on fragment 3 tab(not clicking onsearchview in third fragment),back to fragment 1,searchview expanding

Is there any issue related to the focus of searchview? or am i calling the supportInvalidateOptionsMenu() in some unusual way?

But action bar didn't update itself on version 4.2.x and higher.

What i'm doing is that, i inflate new layout when custom button is clicked, but action bar didn't update itself visually....

I've tried to add Edit text in custom layout. when i add an EditText, soft keyboard also popups, which i think is that it is working perfectly at backend, only action bar is not updating itself visually.

Kindly can you tell me what can be the issue ?

Basically, once an action mode is used, from that point on the overflow bar will be messed up (no text, not clickable) until the screen is rotated (and everything is drawn fresh). See screenshots.

Here we see an action mode being used

![device-2013-11-15-141735](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4555882/1552869/db577716-4e2a-11e3-8949-761c141ae3a9.png)

Subsequent screen has its overflow wiped out (the divider bar between items is still visible)

![device-2013-11-15-141752](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4555882/1552871/db629f42-4e2a-11e3-9251-38ed5d340c0c.png)

Rotating the device brings the buttons back

![device-2013-11-15-141806](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4555882/1552870/db627e0e-4e2a-11e3-97a8-215b35dc9b7a.png)

Rotating the device again, we see that buttons are now there

![device-2013-11-15-141819](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4555882/1552872/db62bf90-4e2a-11e3-8767-4adf57a57896.png)

This is definitely isolated to the action mode. On a fresh app start everything is working perfect until the moment any of the action modes are invoked.

i tried invalidateOptionsMenu() on action mode destroy, but that did not help.

Any thoughts?

While you wait this issue to be resolved, you can use Theme.Sherlock.Light.DarkActionBar  as your AppBaseTheme to be overide with your style. It works for me.

```
<style name="AppBaseTheme" parent="@style/Theme.Sherlock.Light">
   ...
</style>
<style name="AppBaseViewPagerTheme" parent="@style/AppBaseTheme">
    <item name="vpiTitlePageIndicatorStyle">@style/AppBaseTitlePageIndicator</item>

In the activity:

``` java
TabsAdapter tabsAdapter = new TabsAdapter(this, viewPager);

ActionBar.Tab test = getSupportActionBar().newTab();
test.setContentDescription("test");
test.setText("Test");
tabsAdapter.addTab(test, TestFragment.class, null);
```

The text changes and appears correctly, but the content description does not.  Any ideas?

I have a strange problem with ActionBarSherlock, using tab navigation and an Action Mode I obtain an overlapping between these elments.

I repeat the problem simply extend the project "TabNavigation" in demo sample, obtaining this:
1. Application start (portrait mode) and it works correctly;
   ![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5796604/1427848/c6bc58d8-4094-11e3-9fc0-14a9b7652da3.png)
2. I rotate application and it works correctly;
   ![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5796604/1427847/c6bc21b0-4094-11e3-856b-eae0fef2d596.png)
3. I rotate again application and now tab navigation and ActionMode are overlapped.
   ![3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5796604/1427849/c6d3306c-4094-11e3-8399-42c1f691d3ec.png)

Code works correctly on Android 4.0 (tested on real device and emulator), but on Jelly Bean (tested only on emulator) I have the previously behavior.
Sometimes (but rarely), all works perfectly, especially if I have all animations enable in Dev. Setting (usually I disable all animations).

I'm using ActionBarSherlock 4.4.

The example code is the follow:

``` java
import com.actionbarsherlock.app.ActionBar;
import com.actionbarsherlock.app.SherlockFragmentActivity;
import com.actionbarsherlock.app.ActionBar.Tab;
import com.actionbarsherlock.view.ActionMode;
import com.actionbarsherlock.view.Menu;
import com.actionbarsherlock.view.MenuItem;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction;

public class MainActivity extends SherlockFragmentActivity implements ActionBar.TabListener {
    private ActionMode actionMode = null;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        setTheme(com.actionbarsherlock.R.style.Theme_Sherlock);
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        getSupportActionBar().setNavigationMode(ActionBar.NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS);
        for (int i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
            ActionBar.Tab tab = getSupportActionBar().newTab();
            tab.setText("Tab " + i);
            tab.setTabListener(this);
            getSupportActionBar().addTab(tab);
        }

        actionMode = startActionMode(new TestActionMode());
    }

    @Override
    public void onTabSelected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft)  { /* TODO Auto-generated method stub */ }

    @Override
    public void onTabUnselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft)  { /* TODO Auto-generated method stub */ }

    @Override
    public void onTabReselected(Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft)  { /* TODO Auto-generated method stub */ }


    private final class TestActionMode implements ActionMode.Callback {

        @Override
        public boolean onCreateActionMode(ActionMode mode, Menu menu) {
            menu.add("Add").setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_input_add).setShowAsAction(MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM);
            menu.add("Search").setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_search_category_default).setShowAsAction(MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM);

            return true;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean onPrepareActionMode(ActionMode mode, Menu menu) { /* TODO Auto-generated method stub */ return false; }

        @Override
        public boolean onActionItemClicked(ActionMode mode, MenuItem item) { /* TODO Auto-generated method stub */ return false; }

        @Override
        public void onDestroyActionMode(ActionMode mode) { /* TODO Auto-generated method stub */ }
    }

}
```

Has anyone similar problem? Is there any solution or workaround for that?

I use this library and I find it fantastic! But now I have a problem, especially the problem mentioned in the title. I get this error only on devices with Android API level 10 (and maybe with previous levels), but on devices with Android API level 11 and up all works well. The problem consists in an inappropriate layout of the UI. How you can see on the attached image, 
![problem with actionbarsherlock](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3171657/1310500/24b93eee-31f2-11e3-9a1c-992809c98de0.png)
the layout is on the left of the screen instead of to be to the center of the screen, and the reason is proper the problem mentioned above in the title.

I use the ABS how explained from the documentation and stop. I'm not using anything from ABS's internal package, I only extended my activities from Sherlock activities. Before yesterday, ABS worked very well. I searched for the getTranslationY method of the FrameLayout widget and I have noticed that this method was added into SKD from API Level 11, while Android 2.3.X is API Level 10.

On most devices, this works just fine, when I scroll between fragments in the pager the menu items update in the action bar as you would expect. However when I run the app on a device with a hardware menu button the menu items don't appear until either I press the menu button, or I scroll to another fragment and back again.

Here are some screens:
Screen 1, Fragment showing with a pager. The child fragment has menu items, but they aren't showing.
![screenshot_2013-09-02-22-01-07](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2042905/1069353/85bbf0ac-1414-11e3-9170-5f91a4bf1180.png)

Screen 2, The menu items have appeared in the action bar no that the overflow has been opened by pressing the menu button.

It didn't work. In fact I see that at least setIconified doesn't work either. Is this behavior expected from creating searchView on onCreateOptionsMenu method ? Because the only way I could make it work is by adding the modified searchView to ActionBar.

```
@Override
public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
    boolean isLight = SampleList.THEME == R.style.Theme_Sherlock_Light;
    final SearchView searchView = new SearchView(getSupportActionBar().getThemedContext());            
   searchView.setQuery("test", false);

    menu.add("Search")
        .setIcon(isLight ? R.drawable.ic_search_inverse : R.drawable.abs__ic_search)
        .setActionView(searchView)
        .setShowAsAction(MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM | MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_COLLAPSE_ACTION_VIEW);

    return true;
}

1289        mQueryTextView.setText("");
https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/blob/master/actionbarsherlock/src/com/actionbarsherlock/widget/SearchView.java#L1289

Maybe it could set it to mUserQuery instead, I don't know...

If what you want to is to default a search value for when the user expands the search view, you could try overriding the OnActionExpandListener, e.g.:

```
    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        [...]

        // Search...
        MenuItem searchMenuItem = menu.add("Search");
        searchMenuItem.setIcon(isLight ? R.drawable.ic_search_inverse : R.drawable.abs__ic_search)
                      .setActionView(searchView)
                      .setShowAsAction(MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM | MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_COLLAPSE_ACTION_VIEW);

        searchMenuItem.setOnActionExpandListener(new OnActionExpandListener() {
            @Override
            public boolean onMenuItemActionExpand(MenuItem p_menuItem) {
                SearchView searchView = (SearchView) p_menuItem.getActionView();
                searchView.onActionViewExpanded();
                searchView.setQuery("TEST", true);
                return true;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean onMenuItemActionCollapse(MenuItem p_menuItem) {
                return true;
            }
        });

        return true;
    }
```

You may notice that inside onMenuItemActionExpand() I am calling searchView.onActionViewExpanded() - if you don't call it in there, it will get called afterwards and it will blank your search value again (again, found by putting a breakpoint in ABS SearchView code).

HTH,

As they're not useful for neither the library nor developers[1], I think it's reasonable to remove them:
- listPreferredItemHeightSmall
- listPreferredItemPaddingLeft
- listPreferredItemPaddingRight
- textAppearanceListItemSmall
- windowMinWidthMajor
- windowMinWidthMinor
- actionSpinnerItemStyle
- horizontalDivider
- verticalDivider
- headerBackground
- windowAnimationStyle
- itemIconDisabledAlpha

[1] there aren't any values set for them on ABS' themes

On older `APIs` I have the following problem:

Everything is fine when I start my app:

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mZ5Ff.png)

All goes well even when I start action mode and select a couple of items:

![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/46zve.png)

But when I exit (finish) action mode `ActionBarSherlock` crashes. I mean that it's no loger visible, only when I start or finish action mode, it blinks very shortly that I can see icons:
![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EzssT.png)

So only updates show ActionBar for a short moment (it blinks), but after that it remains "hidden" (covered) again.

Has anyone similar problem? Is there any sollution for that?

,2013-08-19T20:54:09Z,2013-08-19T20:54:09Z22903606,18039519,KamilLelonek,Yes, I've tested it with both 4.2 and 4.3.

,2013-08-20T01:31:04Z,2013-08-20T01:31:04Z22917331,18039519,bradmcmanus,Ah, strange. I only see the unwanted behavior on a device running Gingerbread. I suspected it was a problem with the ported ActionMode and other ActionBar related classes necessary for 2.3 devices.
,2013-08-20T01:42:02Z,2013-08-20T01:42:02Z22917462,18039519,rishabhmhjn,My problem is when I scroll through a list in the activity, the actionbar disappears and come backs upon touching at its position. I do not use action mode though.
,2013-08-20T01:46:01Z,2013-08-20T01:46:01Z22924003,18039519,KamilLelonek,Are u  using some custom list view or something or everything goes the "normal way"?
,2013-08-20T05:51:09Z,2013-08-20T05:51:09Z22964266,18039519,bradmcmanus,Seems to be a problem either way. In one case the ActionBar is using a customView, in another case the ActionBar just has an icon and title set on it.
,2013-08-20T17:56:41Z,2013-08-20T17:56:41Z22981948,18039519,bradmcmanus,FYI, we tracked it down to being an issue with NOA. We removed the ABS included NOA in favor of the NOA jar, and this was the source of the contextual action bar issue.
,2013-08-20T22:12:12Z,2013-08-20T22:12:12Z22982104,18039519,KamilLelonek,What does NOA stand for? Is the problem solved?
,2013-08-20T22:14:46Z,2013-08-20T22:14:46Z22982532,18039519,bradmcmanus,Ah, NineOldAndroids. ABS includes a stripped down version of NineOldAndroids in its source but there is also a standalone NineOldAndroids library with more features. Our problem was resolved by making sure to use the com.actionbarsherlock.internal.nineoldandroids (as happens by default, unless you modify the ABS source).
,2013-08-20T22:22:25Z,2013-08-20T22:22:25Z22982941,18039519,KamilLelonek,I use modified ABS without NOA package, which is provided from external library project, because previous configuration (NOA package and NOA library which is required by project) caused conflicts.
,2013-08-20T22:29:42Z,2013-08-20T22:29:42Z40470183,18039519,jenzz,Yep. I can confirm using the **com.actionbarsherlock.internal.nineoldandroids** methods instead of an external .jar fixes this issue.
,2014-04-15T11:14:47Z,2014-04-15T11:15:02Z17957293,17957293,josemando,This is repost from [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18157080/actionbar-overflowing-on-pre-ics-devices).

I'm using ActionBarSherlock with custom tab images that fit perfectly the device, but for some unknown reason are overflowing on Android 2.2 and 2.3 (it works nice on 4.0+). 
I created [this GIF](http://i.imgur.com/qNbAOOG.gif) that shows the behavior.

I've already set android:paddingLeft and android:paddingRight to 0, but it still doesn't work.

Any ideas what is the reason for that?
,2013-08-12T18:42:45Z,2013-10-08T14:33:28Z25788823,17957293,JakeWharton,What version of ABS? I think this was already fixed.

The issue is not with using in a library, but rather within the Android test classes that are using Butterknife. 
In the library, everything works fine, but in my testActivities, the R2.java is not generating the constants needed to recognize for binding.

In the @BindView, Android Studio wants the R.id.test_login to be constant which I could do by declaring @BindView(R2.id.test_login) except the constant variable is not generated in R2.java.

When I migrate the butterknife calls to R2, the variable becomes red and is not recognised. When I search within the R2.java, I will not find that variable at all, mainly because it has not been generated.
So, How do I get butterknife to recognize R2 in a library test class?,2019-10-17T15:35:36Z,2019-10-17T15:40:33Z508327585,508327585,aojiaoqiang,I have an old project that needs an upgrade recently. I upgraded AndroidX first, then butterknife from 8.5.0 to 10.2.0, and I also installed documentation using @bindview (r2.id.xx).
However, I found that the XXXActivity_ViewBinding was not generated correctly after building the project. I checked all the configuration items and they all seemed to be correct.
So I try to create a new demo to verify whether it is a configuration problem. After the demo verification, the Project is normal. Then I try ReBuild Project and Invalidate Caches/Restart several times...However, the ViewBinding file has not been generated, which causes my project cannot run normally, as long as it runs, it will be a mistake, because the views are all NULL. Finally, I tried to manually clean the cache of Android Studio and the cache of Gradle, but this problem still cannot be solved. I hope someone can help me, thank you!

I guess the binding might not be being generated? Please can you help me find steps to fix this issue?

From the Logs:
```
D/ButterKnife: Looking up binding for com.littlesparkshospital.littletrial.activities.MainActivity
D/ButterKnife: Not found. Trying superclass androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
```

XML:
```
<RelativeLayout
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"

                android:layout_toRightOf="@+id/setting_image"
                android:id="@+id/map_container">
```
Java:
```
@BindView(R.id.map_container)
RelativeLayout mapContainer;
```

I am using version 10.1.0 of butterknife:
```
implementation 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:10.1.0'
annotationProcessor 'com.jakewharton:butterknife-compiler:10.1.0'
```

It looks like the MainActivity_ViewBinding.java is being generated as I would have expected, so I guess that the library can't find this generated code at runtime? :/

If there is a need to change, I am willing to do my utmost.

I solved this problem [Missing resource ID for OnClick annotation #1498](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/issues/1498)  these days . Next, I will analyze the reasons and solutions.Please take a look ,thanks

Reason:
When using kotlin, for the same resource, if you do not use other annotations (eg: @Bindview) before the event annotation (eg: @Onclick), after generating view_binding.java, the Utils.findRequiredView() uses a raw integer not R reference.

When the merged resource is packaged, the static value of the R file has changed. So it leads "Missing resource ID". 

Analysis:
The annotation processing of kotlin generates a stub java file and processes the annotation according to the java file.But at this time ,Java file already using raw integer

My solution is to solve in the process() method, if it is the first time use a raw integer, go through the R.java, find the corresponding static value in R.java, and use R reference replace it.
If the second time is a raw integer, it will not be processed because the same resource will use the same Id(butterknife.compiler.Id.java).

If this view is optional add '@Nullable' (fields) or '@Optional' (methods) annotation.`

`onCreateView() {
        ButterKnife.bind(this, rootView)
}`

`onViewCreated() {
       ButterKnife.bind(this, rootView);
}`

I have to remove this line from `onCreateView()` to `onViewCreated()` to remove the error mentioned above.
But after a few runs from Studio, I have to remove this line from `onViewCreated()` and write it back to `onCreateView()` to remove the error mentioned above.

And the loop continues, is there any permanent place where I should keep it?,2019-07-04T09:04:27Z,2019-10-17T20:12:00Z510905582,464152012,scana,Is there any chance that you have this in your dependencies section:

} else {

For some reason `@org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable` works if the type of the field is a subclass of `android.view.View`. But it fails if the type of the field is the `android.view.View` class. In the code below the `B` and `C` classes can be processed as expected. Class `A` fails during annotation processing.

`com/example/TestBindView.java`:

```java
package com.example;

import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import butterknife.BindView;

class A {
    @org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable @BindView(0) View button;
}

class B {
    @androidx.annotation.Nullable @BindView(0) View button;
}

class C {
    @org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable @BindView(0) Button button;
}
```

```
com/example/TestBindView.java:8: error: @BindView fields must extend from View or be an interface. (com.example.A.button)
    @org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable @BindView(0) View button;

Having `@OnClick(R2.id. ...)` annotation in library module crashes the app with `java.lang.IllegalStateException Required view (...) with ID (...) for method (..) was not found.` when [`Butterknife.bind(this)`](https://github.com/mateuszkwiecinski/butternkife_bug/blob/master/library/src/main/java/pls/help/butterknife/LibraryActivity.kt#L20) is called.
```
   @BindView(R2.id.willWork)
    lateinit var thisNeedsToBeHere: View

    @OnClick(R2.id.btnInLibrary)
    fun start(){ ... }

    @OnClick(R2.id.willWork)
    fun start2(){ ...}
```
Generated `ViewBinding` class looks as follows:

You may notice it does not use `R.id.*` reference for the `btnInLibrary` view. 
Interesting thing is that if you add `BindView` annotation with `R2.id.willWork` resource - it references proper resource.
Tested with kotlin `1.3.31`, `1.3.21` and `1.3.20` (which supposedly fixed #974) 
Butterknife `10.1.0`, AGP `3.4.1`

I think this would greatly increase the chances of open source enthusiasts, especially new ones, contributing to this project. Without this documentation, a potential new developer would not know how to make any contributions, or whether or not any are welcome. ,2019-05-14T17:08:03Z,2019-05-14T17:08:03Z442916021,442916021,LucioC,So I'm having an issue in an App where my buttons that have OnClick methods registered with Butterknife stop working.

The basic scenario is like that:
I have an Activity A with a camera view and 3 buttons (options like timer, flash and camera selection). The code is not consistent so the first button creates a listener and set it with setOnClickListener, and buttons 2 and 3 are using the OnClick of butterknife.

To reproduce this error I do the following in my app (It appears on an Samsung S7 with android 8, but I was not able to reproduce with other devices yet):
1) I start activity A with the camera,
2) Take a picture
3) It opens an Activity B with a preview of the photo
4) Press Back
5) It comes back to activity A again (not destroyed)
6) repeat steps 2-5 (once)
7) at this point buttons 2 and 3 do not respond anymore

I have debugged the application and got to the point of looking at the code of the listener that is being registered by Butterknife on the buttons, that is the  [DebouncingOnClickListener](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/blob/94729fcb85deae93d89617f44e40749163838f39/butterknife-runtime/src/main/java/butterknife/internal/DebouncingOnClickListener.java)

In debug I can see that after the two photos and back and forth on the activities, the state of the 'enabled' variable in this listener is false, so it does not call my registered methods on the click of the buttons anymore. Looking at this class it seems that the design intends to temporarily disable the listener execution to avoid multiple clicks in small intervals, and set the 'enabled' state back at the end, which for some reason in this process I described is failing.

It seems the [view.post()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#post(java.lang.Runnable)) method that is called to enable the listener again can fail which may be what is happening. This state variable is also static, which blocks all events registered with the OnClick on other objects.

To open activity B in my app there is some processing, a thread and an async task executing which I believe may be responsible to cause some inconsistency in this case, which I have not determined yet. 

Any thoughts about this? Shouldn't Butterknife insure the state is reset?

,2019-05-10T22:28:16Z,2019-05-29T02:11:52Z491845622,442916021,LucioC,I have found the issue. Because of a postDelayed call on activity B, the app was calling performClick() on a view that had no activity anymore. So the view.post() method fails and the 'enabled' state is not updated.

Seems to be the same issue as #766 . Maybe document this limitation (cannot call performClick() on a deattached view), or better solution would be if was possible to provide some other mechanism to reenable the state of the listener.

Butterknife seems to be a great project, but looking through the Issues reported and the PR list can be a little bit overwhelming for a first-time user, and that includes both people who are trying to newly contribute to the project as OSS contributors but also people trying to use the tool in their own projects. 

For example, labels like “easy” or “good first issue” might be helpful for people new to the community. I do see that there are labels on some of the issues already, which is helpful!, but those are definitely the minority. When I click on the "labels" button from inside the issues tab, I see a lot of those labels are there and that's great! Standardizing their use could be helpful to someone new like me. 

 In PRs, I could imagine something like “bug fix” or “ready for review” or anything to indicate the flow of the PR through the project.

I noticed that some of the issues have labels, such as "bug," "duplicate," and "Help Wanted." So an easy fix could be to add tags like "easy first issue," "beginner friendly," and "quick fix," etc. This could greatly increase the speed with which issues are dealt with.,2019-05-14T17:24:00Z,2019-05-14T17:24:00Z440169313,440169313,themass,hello，  my gradle verion=5.1.1 plugin=3.4.0

I am having a problem now, as follows:
My app consists of 4 projects and is divided into 3 layers. The bottom layer is a base-lib, the middle layer is two business layers, and the top layer is an APP container that loads these three projects. Now I found a problem. When the top-level container introduces the other three items in lib mode, the other three items will have R2 id duplicates, resulting in the generated _ViewBinding class having some exception errors that cannot be found. How can I solve it?
thank you very much!

Everything works fine except the object names under @BindView remains the same 

That is , the decompiled class file looks like this 

```
@BindView
TextView name;
@BindView
TextView date
```

But other objects are obfuscated 
`String name ==> String bc ;`

Why this problem occurs in Butterknife ?

I am using Butterknife 10 

My progaurd file 
```

-dontwarn com.razorpay.*

-dontwarn javax.annotation.Nullable
-dontwarn okhttp3.internal.platform.ConscryptPlatform

perhaps related to that, it is able to generate correct _ViewBinding code for views but somehow not for `OnClick` functions.
```
View view;
    target.toolbar = Utils.findRequiredViewAsType(source, R.id.toolbar, "field 'toolbar'", Toolbar.class);
    view = Utils.findRequiredView(source, com.mypackage.R.id.information_about, "field 'info' and method 'onClickAbout'");
    target.info = view;
    view7f0b006e = view;
    view.setOnClickListener(new DebouncingOnClickListener() {
      @Override
      public void doClick(View p0) {
        target.onClickAbout();
      }
    });
    view = Utils.findRequiredView(source, 2131427440, "method 'onClickTermsAndCondition'");
    view7f0b0070 = view;
    view.setOnClickListener(new DebouncingOnClickListener() {
      @Override
      public void doClick(View p0) {
        target.onClickTermsAndCondition();
      }
    });

```
It looks like it's still use an int reference rather than actual `R` reference for `OnClick`
I'm using latest BK and kotlin 1.3.30

here is the repo to reproduce this issue
https://github.com/cooperkong/butterknifeR2issue
It crashes with `ResourceNotFound` if launch `Activity2` which is in a seperate module. however if I uncomment `@BindView` in `Activity2` it works.
```
class Activity2: AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.lib2_layout)
        ButterKnife.bind(this)
    }
//    @BindView(R2.id.textview2)
//    lateinit var textView: TextView

    @OnClick(R2.id.textview2)
    fun donothing() {

    }
}
```

Reason:
When using kotlin, for the same resource, if you do not use other annotations (eg: @bindview) before the event annotation (eg: @onclick), after generating view_binding.java, the Utils.findRequiredView() uses a raw integer not R reference.

When the merged resource is packaged, the static value of the R file has changed. So it leads "Missing resource ID". 

Analysis:
The annotation processing of kotlin generates a stub java file and processes the annotation according to the java file.But at this time ,Java file already using raw integer

My solution is to solve in the process() method, if it is the first time a raw integer, go through the R.java, find the corresponding static value in R.java, and use R reference replace it.
If the second time is a raw integer, it will not be processed because the same resource will use the same Id(butterknife.compiler.Id.java).,2019-07-27T16:14:31Z,2019-07-27T16:14:31Z543396059,433056209,difereto-globant,@JantHsueh was your PR merged?

But even ignoring that, I immediately wanted to use unsafeCast in Okio common even if it only applied to the JVM. So perhaps that is a good first step for multiplatform support: just the API which is erased on native, delegates to stdlib on JS, and compiler plugin for JVM.,2020-03-10T15:37:55Z,2020-03-10T15:37:55Z591018490,591018490,marcin-kozinski,Hey, do you mind if I send a simple PR updating README.md to have any usage steps at all?

I'm thinking of something like all the important stats exported to a text file. Maintaining a bunch of apk snapshots (for comparisons) seems not to make any sense, when I could be maintaining a number of text files for a fraction of the cost. 

If the lightweight input was available I could be keeping the text file for every single commit on `master` (or at least X last of them) and using it as the base for comparisons on my Pull Requests.,2019-11-18T10:23:26Z,2019-11-19T20:55:17Z555663208,524270933,JakeWharton,I mentioned to someone about serializing the models to proto which would produce smaller files to retain. But that it was very, very low priority.

That being said, you already should only be keeping the last X of APKs for this tool anyway. The likelihood of someone branching from a commit that's more than a few hundred old is low, and even if that occurs you can fallback to either the oldest APK or the newest APK.,2019-11-19T19:11:18Z,2019-11-19T19:11:18Z555709363,524270933,blipinsk,> I mentioned to someone about serializing the models to proto which would produce smaller files to retain.

Noted. 

> That being said, you already should only be keeping the last X of APKs for this tool anyway. The likelihood of someone branching from a commit that's more than a few hundred old is low, and even if that occurs you can fallback to either the oldest APK or the newest APK.

The scale of the problem really depends on the APK size. Regardless of the apk storing "issue", uploading and downloading of 35+ MB apks (example of what I'm handling on a daily basis at the moment) would increase the usage of the precious CI time. Especially if there are multiple build types (apks) to be compared per master commit.

Our tests, unfortunately, don't follow a convention that I can use to parse them out, instead we rely on `@Test` annotations.

It would be very nice if the annotations of the method could be available, perhaps behind an option.

I tried to implement this myself, but I got stuck with the DEX file format and did not get the correct annotations out. Here is my WIP

https://github.com/andersjanmyr/dex-method-list/blob/add_annotations_methods/src/main/kotlin/com/jakewharton/dex/DexMethods.kt#L103-L126

If you can give me a pointer in the right direction, I would very much appreciate it.

Right now, the system is using image from resources folder for indicating the 
active and inactive points.

Is it possible to load images dynamically from the server based on the point id 
(or a point attribute for image)?

Generally, weekly projects take between 5-10 hours to complete the required features and an additional 5-10 hours to complete the optional features. In general, we've seen that the more hours you log, the quicker you improve your proficiency with iOS.

The purpose of this project was to begin to explore Xcode and to get a broad overview of iOS development using Objective-C or Swift. For example, in this project, we explored the following concepts:
- Code styling in Objective-C or Swift. You can find some code styling guides here:
  - [The New York Times Objective-C Style Guide](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide)
  - [Ray Wenderlich Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)
  - [Github Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide)
- Views are created in Storyboard, Interface Builder, or programatically, but they have the same goal: instantiate, initialize, and layout view objects. We use IBOutlets to give names to view objects, similar to giving unique ids to divs in HTML.
- We registered for touch events, which can be done programatically or via IBActions.
- We explored NSUserDefaults, one of the four persistence strategies in iOS.
- View controllers have a set of methods that are called when it loads, appears, or disappears. These are called view controller lifecycle methods.
- Do your views look good on iPhone 4, 5, and 6? Do your views look good on both iOS 6 vs iOS 7/8? We will cover in class how to use Auto Layout to robustly design your views for different screen sizes and OS versions.
- After this assignment, you should understand the purpose of IBOutlets and IBActions as well as the basics of designing views and programmatically interacting with the views from the controller.

The next step is to schedule a brief phone conversation with me [here](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UVBDTi1jVkx4SldqfGRlZmF1bHR8MGVhNTlkZDFmYzQzODdkNDFhZjQ0NWQyZjFiMDU3Nzg). I have appointment slots every week through January 23rd. Admission is rolling, so the sooner you schedule, the better. Once you've selected a time, update the calendar event with a phone number to call you at.

During the phone calls, I'll ask you a few simple language questions such as strong vs weak properties, blocks/closures, and categories/extensions. I'll also ask you about why you want to learn iOS and what apps you're interested in building.
,2014-12-19T17:54:01Z,2014-12-19T17:54:01Z59436843,59436843,ctuong,Hi @codepathreview, this is my submission for Twitter part 2. Thanks!
,2015-03-02T04:13:41Z,2015-03-06T21:19:26Z77637777,59436843,codepathreview,Nice work! We added this homework so that you'll have the experience building an app that's more similar in complexity to a production app. It's also useful to have practical experience building a container view controller, which is a more advanced topic. The optional account switching feature is interesting because you have to think about how TwitterClient is caching the access token to make sure it works correctly for multiple accounts. Displaying the account switching screen is implemented using custom view controller transitions.

A few notes after checking out the code:
- Nice work encapsulating the properties into the private class extension for better encapsulation.
- Good coding style for the properties. The compiler generates important things in the getters and setters that get circumvented when the instance variables are used directly (the variables that are prefixed with underscore). Always use self.property to access a property.
- Nice work specifying the Auto Layout constraints.
- Nice work implementing the profile view controller so that it doesn't duplicate code in the timeline view controller.
- Nice work encapsulating the properties of the custom cells that you added.
- You should consider what a more generic design for your hamburger controller might look like. Right now, it's tightly bound to this Twitter application.
- You should consider implementing the blurred table view header. There are several approaches here that are all valid. You can implement the header has a table header, a section header, or a cell. My preferred approach is to implement it as a table header, it's the easiest way to flow the image above the content. These detail touches are where you really learn the nooks and crannies of the framework.

Congratulations on finishing the final assignment! It's impressive to realize that in just four weeks, you've gone from building a simple tip calculator app to a polished MVC client.

If this were 2009, you would be well on your way to building most apps that you could find in the app store. Over the next few weeks, we'll be focusing on custom views and view controllers to implement the interactions and visual effects that we find in more modern iOS apps.

Here's a checklist of things that I'm looking for in this project. You should review the checklist, and make any changes to your project, if necessary.
- In Objective-C, review your .h files. Your classes should reveal a minimum interface and only expose things that must be used by other classes.
- Each .xib file or Storyboard scene should have Auto Layout constraints specified for each view.
- There should be no yellow Auto Layout warnings, even if the layout seems to work. Auto Layout warnings are like having bad HTML. The browser will try to render it, and it might even look right, but it won't be fully predictable.
- In your custom TweetCell, there is a conditionally present label that starts with "retweeted by ...". Did you create an outlet for that constraint and programatically modify the constant depending if the label is present or hidden?
- Did you handle reply/retweet/favorite actions from within the TweetCell? This is an example where it's useful for your model to be able to handle network actions, so you can simply wire up the buttons to a method like `[tweet retweet]` (Objective-C) or `tweet.retweet()` (Swift). You can even pass in an optional closure if you want to handle a failure of the network event.
- If you're using Objective-C, you can consider using Mantle, a lightweight ORM that eliminates a lot of boilerplate. It's also compatible with Core Data if your project requires that.
- If you're using Swift, you can consider using SwiftyJSON for easier deserialization of the JSON response.
- In your ComposeViewController, did you pass back the Tweet after it was successfully created? This will allow you to locally insert newly created tweets so you don't have to do a network refresh to see the new tweets.

For each point in the homework feedback checklist, I'll either confirm that you're on the right track with the implementation, or I'll provide some feedback:
- Nice work encapsulating the properties into the private class extension for better encapsulation.
- Good coding style for the properties. The compiler generates important things in the getters and setters that get circumvented when the instance variables are used directly (the variables that are prefixed with underscore). Always use self.property to access a property.
- Nice work specifying the Auto Layout constraints.
- Nice work handling the retweet label by dynamically modifying the constraint. This is a situation where its not possible to specify the behavior that you want solely using Interface Builder.
- Nice work setting up the controls within the Tweet cells. It can sometimes be hard to have a clean design for embedded controls because it usually involves cumbersome plumbing. This is an instance where I think having the model handle the network action helps greatly simplify the implementation.
- You should consider using Mantle, it's a lightweight ORM that eliminates a lot of boilerplate, and it's also compatible with Core Data if your project requires that.
- Nice work handling the post tweet insertion into the feed. In real MVC apps, the more polished experiences have to do a certain amount of local object management to make a fully seamless experience.
- note that you do not have to reload the whole table on a new tweet

In general, you should challenge yourself to create visually polished applications. That's where you'll find all the rough edges of the iOS framework and earn the next level of mastery.

The primary challenge of this homework was to learn how to use UITableView to manage a complex form, establish communication between view controllers, and apply the correct Auto Layout constraints. For each point in the homework feedback checklist, I'll either confirm that you're on the right track with the implementation, or I'll provide some feedback:
- For the restaurant cell, nice work encapsulating the properties into the private class extension.
- Note that you should resolve all the Auto Layout constraint warnings in your nibs. (BusinessCell.xib)
- Nice work linking the filter model with the controls. See this [popular form library](https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms) for an alternative to implementing forms manually.
- Nice work connecting the view controllers via the custom filter delegate. This is a popular pattern for handling events between view controllers.

This was a challenging assignment, congrats on completing it successfully!

For each point in the homework feedback checklist, I'll either confirm that you're on the right track with the implementation, or I'll provide some feedback:
- Be sure to follow the Objective-C code styling conventions for the homework. The New York Times has a good summary of appropriate Objective-C coding conventions, you should take a quick look [here](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide).
- https://github.com/ctuong/Rotten-Tomatoes/blob/master/Rotten%20Tomatoes/MovieViewController.h You should always try to minimize the number of properties and methods in the header files and move all private properties and methods into the class extension (the @interface block in the .m file).
- In future homework, we will cover how to implement models that can deserialize from an NSDictionary. It might be interesting to check out the Mantle project for a lightweight ORM.
- Your custom Movie cell should have a property called `movie`. In the custom setter of `movie`, you should configure the various labels and images. This decouples your custom cells from the table view controllers.
- Nice work loading the images asynchronously.
- Nice work setting up the proper modes for the images so that they are not stretched.
- Nice work implementing the error message on network failure.

In general, you should challenge yourself to create visually polished applications. That's where you'll find all the rough edges of the iOS framework and earn the next level of mastery.

We create the Bootstrap modal from string templates - everything else (display-wise) is pure Bootstrap. I would assume that patch file is for a much earlier version of Bootstrap, especially since this project was created for Bootstrap 2.

If you really want to mix these projects (which, I'll be honest, I don't entirely get), I would suggest creating a jsFiddle or similar that demonstrates what you're seeing. If you do that, I will try to take a look at what the problem might be, although I make no promises that I could come up with a fix.,2017-09-12T00:30:41Z,2017-09-12T00:30:41Z328699388,253573216,jschr,hey all, it's been a long time since I've touched this lib and have not used bootstrap in a long time so maintenance / development has pretty much halted. I believe at some point bootbox and this plugin could play nicely but it's not something I ever accounted or tested for. 

Thanks @tiesont for offering to take a look at this. I share the sentiment that if someone can provide a jsfiddle / reproducible I'll see what I can do to help find a workaround or if theres a simple fix I would gladly accept PRs. ,2017-09-12T00:53:28Z,2017-09-12T17:51:53Z329033358,253573216,jellybins, @tiesont i see the bootbox  doesn't have any styles files.   but it‘s script used original bootstrap modal .  and this bootstrap-modal's style file "bootstrap-modal-bs3patch.css" change the original style . then make the bootbox’s window（also can call it “the original bootstrap modal”） becomes abnormal  .   and "bootstrap-modal-bs3patch.css" isn't use to compatible for previous  versions of bootstrap , it's used for bootstrap 3. ,2017-09-13T01:49:25Z,2017-09-13T01:49:25Z329049475,253573216,tiesont,@jellybins I am aware of what the various files are used for; I used bootstrap-modal prior to switching to (and eventually becoming a maintainer for) Bootbox, and I still recommend it for devs that want more control over their modals than Bootbox can accommodate. The problem is that Bootstrap's modal markup has changed a little in each version of Bootstrap - even Bootstrap 4 requires updates to how modals are made, something I'm working on for the next version of Bootbox. There are also subtle differences in how the actual modal plugin works in each version of Bootstrap (in part due to how the markup changes). 

It's also worth noting that bootstrap-modal, rather than encapsulating it's own function name, replaces the `$.fn.modal` function from Bootstrap.js - since Bootbox calls that internally, I would not be surprised if that is (in part) a reason for unusual behavior in Bootbox.

I'll reiterate my point from above; 

> I would suggest creating a jsFiddle or similar that demonstrates what you're seeing. If you do that, I will try to take a look at what the problem might be, although I make no promises that I could come up with a fix.

I have no problem trying to help you solve this problem (as @jschr says, he's not really active in Bootstrap these days, so...), but I'm not going to go through and try recreating what you're seeing entirely on my own. To quote [Jerry Maguire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/): _"Help me... help you"_,2017-09-13T03:35:13Z,2017-09-13T03:39:17Z329942034,253573216,jellybins,@tiesont @jschr  i found the jsfiddle couldn't  show  modal window then creat the test.html in the upload file. just open that you can see the effect, then edit it remove the ref of ''bootstrap-modal-bs3patch.css"  open thant again.

I _can_ tell you that Bootbox behaves as expected on it's own, in your test file, so it's definitely an issue originating from bootstrap-modal. I'll have to dig into the source to see what's going on, but I'm assuming it's just plain a matter of incompatibility.

Can you tell me exactly what it is you need that leads to trying to load both libraries at the same time?,2017-09-16T04:07:52Z,2017-09-16T04:07:52Z329944311,253573216,tiesont,Here's my take, based on the README for bootstrap-modal;

The latest version (v4) of Bootbox is not compatible with bootstrap-modal, owing to this:

> Since this plugin was created to solve a lot of the issues with BS2, it still uses the BS2 markup syntax.

It _does_ seem to more or less work with the latest [v3](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/bootbox.js/3.3.0) version of Bootbox, which makes sense - Bootbox 3 was built for Bootstrap 2.2, which is where Bootstrap introduced a lot of breaking changes, including changes to the modal plugin and the markup and CSS it uses. If you decide to go that route, you'll want to review the [v3 docs](http://bootboxjs.com/v3.x/), as Bootbox also changed fairly significantly between 3.3 and the 4.0 release.,2017-09-16T04:21:35Z,2017-09-16T04:21:35Z206099279,206099279,Invis1ble,,2017-02-08T05:20:43Z,2017-02-08T05:20:43Z199380023,199380023,cyberzilla,is imposible with this?,2017-01-07T19:26:34Z,2017-01-07T19:26:34Z134874447,134874447,JamesRamm,I know bootstrap components can be made collapsable with a bit of work (although im not sure this works well with modals), but it would be good if you could provide a short cut to be able to collapse/minimize modals.

perhaps a CSS class that can be added to `modal-header` or an element in the modal, such that when the element is clicked, the modal collapses to just that element...

Hello! I am a newer member.
First post. 
I was able to work through several issues myself. But this one needs divine intervention -- common sense and logic is failing.

Looking at the changing code live via FF/Inspector, each time the modal dialog opens it adds padding-right: 15px. It is only after the modal closes the page content within <body>...</body> shifts. Each successive modal dialog opening adds another 15px.

Why -- is there a fix?

The backdrop loads first, and then the modal shows.

I'd like the modal to instantly animate in, together with the backdrop (instead of backdrop first, then modal).

If the page is longer than the viewport and I click the button that opens the modal at the bottom of the page, on modal dialog open, the page scrolls back to the top of the page.

This only occurs if I use ng-include in the modal-body of a bootstrap modal. 

There are 3 plunkrs below. 
The first one http://plnkr.co/edit/ppH9MqmL6FCBR9PpgjYD?p=preview uses angular 1.2.29 and has a modal without an ng-include in the modal-body and works as expected(page does not scroll to top)
The second http://plnkr.co/edit/KHyMuIQQOBzJu8ZkuCS7?p=preview uses angular 1.2.29 and has a modal with an ng-include in the modal-body  (page scrolls to top)
The third one http://plnkr.co/edit/HfyctrZDJNN8Of8aYOTU?p=preview uses angular 1.4.5 and has a modal with an ng-include in the modal-body  (page does not scroll to top)

I have also tried upgrading bootstraps css from 3.1.1 to 3.3.4. This makes no difference

The plunkers above are pretty basic and just there to prove the problem exists. Let me explain my use case for more context. I have an angular template that houses a set of search fields(textfields, dropdowns etc that are used in a number of pages in our application. I would also like to re-use this template in a modal dialog. To do this I include the template in the modal-body of the modal using ng-include

I would upgrade 1.3.x or above, but we currently support ie8 :-(

Any feedback welcome

How to construct ajax contact form? 
I have an js-script

``` javascript
$(document).on('submit', '#contactForm form', function(){

    var temp_href = window.location.pathname.replace('?','&');
    if(temp_href.substr(0,4) == 'http'){
      temp_href = temp_href.substr(7);
      temp_href = temp_href.substr(temp_href.indexOf('/')+1);
    }
    if(temp_href.substr(0,1) == '/'){
      temp_href = temp_href.substr(1);
    }
    if(temp_href.indexOf('#') > -1){
      temp_href = temp_href.substr(0,temp_href.indexOf('#'));
    }
    temp_href = 'q='+temp_href;
    temp_href += '&search_id=contactForm';
    temp_href += '&context=web';

    var form_data = $(this).serialize();

    $('#contactForm')
      .css({
        'height': $('#contactForm').height()+'px',
        'background': 'url("/assets/theme/img/loader.gif") center center no-repeat'
      })

    .children('form').css({'opacity':'0.2'});

    jQuery.ajax({
      url: "/assets/components/ajax_submit/ajax_submit.php?"+temp_href,
      type: "post",
      data: form_data,
      dataType: "html",
      success: function(response){
        jQuery("#contactForm").html(response);

        $('#contactForm')
        .css({
          'height': 'auto',
          'background-image': 'none'
        })
        .children('form').css({'opacity': 1});
        if( $('.success_message').length ){
          $('.success_message').superEffect({
            speed: 1000,
            count: 5
          });
        }
        if( $('div.error').length ){
          $('div.error').parents('.field').addClass('error');
        }
      }

    });

   return false;  
});
```

How to integrate to 

``` javascript
$(function(){
  $.fn.modal.defaults.spinner = $.fn.modalmanager.defaults.spinner = 
    '<div class="loading-spinner" style="width: 200px; margin-left: -100px;">' +
      '<div class="progress progress-striped active">' +
        '<div class="progress-bar" style="width: 100%;"></div>' +
      '</div>' +
    '</div>';
  $.fn.modalmanager.defaults.resize = true;
});

var $modal = $('#ajax-modal');

$('.ajax .demo').on('click', function(){
  // create the backdrop and wait for next modal to be triggered
  $('body').modalmanager('loading');

  setTimeout(function(){
     $modal.load('tl.html', '', function(){
      $modal.modal();
    });
  }, 1000);
});

$modal.on('click', '.btn-warning', function(){
  $modal.modal('loading');
  setTimeout(function(){
    $modal
      .modal('loading')
      .find('.modal-body')
        .prepend('<div class="alert alert-info fade in">' +
          'Updated!<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button>' +
        '</div>');
  }, 1000);
});
```

,2015-09-15T05:29:03Z,2015-09-16T13:46:20Z140746913,106482498,joelmora,I have the same problem, is a problem related with z-index property on select2 plugin, what I do for temporary fix this problem is assign a z-index property on initialization.

``` javascript
//global javascript
var zIndexSelect2 = 1050;
```

``` javascript
//local javascript
zIndexSelect2 = zIndexSelect2 + 10;

var options = {
    dropdownCss: {
        'z-index': zIndexSelect2
    }
    //other options...
}

//inicialize
$('select').select2(options)
```

so every time you use select2 within a modal you must set zIndexSelect2 + 10 an then set the options otherwise modal will be on top select2.

Is a temporary fix but at least it works for me

I have a datepicker on the top right, and when I click the icon to show the datepicker, since it is in the right border, it shows only the part that it can put in the size. I don't know if it is clear.. I send an image to show. I have tried enlarging it and setting different options without result

I tried in Bootstrap 3.2 and 3.3. The code was attached

I am trying to use this jQuery plugin to create stackable modals. what is important to me is that original parent (the plugin code appends the new opened modals to body). The requirement is that I have to select modal from a click of the button within modal content. that button is in a iframe source within the modal (opened). to select iframe (on click of button) I use window.frameElement and then use jquery 'closest' function to get the modal. 

I figured that the parent of the modal could be queried through jQuery data using 'modal' as the key. what I found was that all the modals are actually appended on top window body the modal data get lost as the modal data was saved (when initially modal was shown) to first / parent modals jQuery instance context. while now the window.parent == window.top on second level modal.

is there any way out.

Thanks,
Gunjan

I can using mouse wheel to scroll page on Chrome browser, how to fix it?
,2014-10-23T10:49:57Z,2014-10-23T10:49:57Z43343965,43343965,1parkplace,It's not throwing any errors in the console, but commenting out the Bootstrap-modal.js and modal manager fixes the issue.

Any idea why this would happen and any setting I can toggle to prevent this from occurring?

Any button I have in a modal that causes a Post Back to ASP.NET will not fire as long as I have Bootstrap-Modal.JS in the page.
,2014-09-21T20:03:21Z,2015-09-22T05:25:35Z56311067,43343965,jschr,To allow for stacking modals properly this plugin will append the modals to document.body when they are opened. There shouldn't be any issues if the form you want to submit is inside the modal itself. If the modal is inside the form and the submit button is part of the modal, submitting the form won't work because the modal is no longer nested in the form when it is opened. 

If for some reason the form cannot be moved to be inside the modal itself that you'll probably have to use a bit of javascript to manually submit the form. 
,2014-09-21T20:13:53Z,2014-09-21T20:13:53Z56311260,43343965,1parkplace,The button and the form are inside the modal-body.

This plugin does not seem to be compatible with ASP.NET web form applications though.  I just looked at the output of the rendered markup and it is producing the modal outside of the ASP.NET <form> tag for the page.  This can't work with ASP.NET, anything involved in posting back needs to exist in the <form> tag of the overall page.
,2014-09-21T20:20:15Z,2014-09-21T20:20:15Z56311596,43343965,jschr,I don't have any experience with ASP.NET web form applications so you'll have to forgive my lack of knowledge about them. Is it possible the issue can be fixed by setting a different modal container other then body? 

`$.fn.modal.defaults.manager = '#app'`
,2014-09-21T20:30:02Z,2014-09-21T20:30:02Z56311685,43343965,1parkplace,Yea! I was just trying that and wanted to report my findings.

Changed manager = 'form' and line 366 and 367 of bootstrap-modal.js to:
                var $baseModal = $('<div class="modal hide" />').appendTo('form'),
                    $baseBackdrop = $('<div class="modal-backdrop hide" />').appendTo('form');

It's working!
,2014-09-21T20:32:20Z,2014-09-21T20:32:20Z56311743,43343965,1parkplace,ASP.NET Web form apps basically put everything inside of a <form> element, allowing for elements in your pages to post back to the server to update information, thus, anything appended to the body can be for display only, but if it is dynamic in nature, it breaks, causing those items to not have any "form" to post to.
,2014-09-21T20:34:37Z,2014-09-21T20:34:37Z56312501,43343965,jschr,ah ok, I don't see anything wrong with your solution as long there's only ever one form element on the page. If there's ever two forms on a page you'll run into some issues. 
,2014-09-21T20:58:23Z,2014-09-21T20:58:23Z142184674,43343965,ivanlewis,any other workaround for this?

- hide modal.
- trigger show modal again.
  script bind lost.

because modal dom removed from dom tree. This not happened in official bootstrap-modal.

I add   modal.appendTo($(document)); to removeContainer to solve problem

```
removeContainer: function (modal) {
            modal.appendTo($(document));
            modal.$container.remove();
            modal.$container = null;
        },

"Uncaught TypeError: modal.appendTo is not a function"

I am destroying the modal and recreating it, not the best.. but for now it works. I don't know if this maybe the same problem why I also get dropbox items cropped out of modal ...

It is very wel explained... the whole point is that you need to return your JSON in a callback-function way

``` css
@media (max-width: 979px) {
    .modal-body,
    .modal-overflow .modal-body {
        position: static;
        margin: 0;
        height: auto !important;
        max-height: none !important;
        overflow: visible !important;
    }
}
```

Can the !important be avoided?  It's usually a bad idea.  Perhaps it is only needed for .modal-overflow ?
,2014-06-18T15:24:41Z,2016-06-08T10:46:57Z46457427,35996743,jschr,Yes I believe you are right in that !important is only intended for the modal-overflow class. I'd gladly except a PR  to fix it if you are able to.
,2014-06-18T16:12:53Z,2014-06-18T16:12:53Z224544748,35996743,nealeu,So do you mean that the following is the intent?

```
.modal-body {
    position: static;
    margin: 0;
    height: auto;
    max-height: none;
    overflow: visible;
}

.modal-overflow .modal-body {
    height: auto !important;
    max-height: none !important;
    overflow: visible !important;
}
```

This also doesn't work.  I had to remove the !important for overflow too.

Add a `value` prop to `<FormProvider>` to allow for updating the form state if props have changed. Also paves the way for improved composability.

```js
<FormProvider form={form} value={props.user} onSubmit={saveUser}>
...

The provided example works just because the activity is exited just after the image was swipped out. Hence, when opening a new image, the whole activity is recreated. 

Here is an example : 
![Screenshot_20200126_164102](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22097904/73137661-dc91d300-405a-11ea-8c9c-251825f196bf.png)

On the left, the image is opened for the first time. On the right, the image has then been swipped out then immediately reopened.

Reason is FrameLayout(android.R.id.content) does not get resized in case of such activities.

I'm afraid I don't have any answers for this ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ,2019-10-18T18:10:13Z,2019-10-18T18:10:19Z440066854,440066854,kakai248,Seems like a weird unrelated issue. But I see it happening.

Whenever I pop a fragment, I hide the keyboard:

```kotlin
fun View.hideKeyboard() {
    handler?.removeCallbacksAndMessages(TOKEN_KEYBOARD)
    context.getSystemService<InputMethodManager>()?.hideSoftInputFromWindow(this.windowToken, InputMethodManager.HIDE_NOT_ALWAYS)
}
```

If I press the back hardware button, the first time closes the keyboard and the second time pops the fragment. This is the normal case where everything works.

Now if I press the close button in the toolbar, the two actions are done at the same time. It closes the keyboard and pops the fragment. This is where I see the problem happening. In this case the popped fragment only goes through `onPause` and `onStop`. `onDestroy` is never called. What happens is that this fragment is removed from the FragmentManager but if I do call `fm.findFragmentByTag` the fragment is `!= null`. It doesn't make any sense.

Now you could be asking "How is this related to this lib?". If I don't use the lib the issue doesn't happen. For some reason the animation in the activity messes up the fragment manager.

Any ideas what it could be?

It seems that setting the height on the view's `LayoutParams` was what was holding up the TransitionsManager from detecting the *original* state of the content view, but we also don't know the bounds on the first pass - adding a `post(Runnable)` allows us to get the proper original height right after the first layout pass.,2018-10-07T22:06:02Z,2019-04-04T17:59:32Z427730075,367598564,saket,Hey this looks really nice, kaeawc.

That was a correct assumption, but I soon realized it was a bad idea because markdown on Reddit is a gigantic pile of broken markdown syntaxes. I tried correcting some of them in the app using regex, but is like a losing battle. 

I'd like to switch back to using the "processed" markdown HTML that Reddit sends. Android offers an HTML parsing using `Html.toHtml()`, but it does not let us use custom spans. We'll have to figure out a way to do that.,2019-01-14T12:25:19Z,2019-01-14T12:25:46Z398681535,398681535,saket,- [ ] UI

Am I missing something or should this information be included in the docs? It would be much easier than locating and installing the appropriate version from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pycairo) as the docs say.

There might be more of this around in the glsl code. I think where floats should be expected it's typically a good idea to use `1.` or `1.0` instead of `1` as it could lead to strange behaviour with some drivers and in this case actually a compiler error.

```
    for point in self.get_template_configuration(place)
TypeError: get_template_configuration() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

    it.cycle(new_template)
NameError: name 'it' is not defined
```

These errors do not appear anymore after fix.

Cheers

Thanks for contributing to manim!

**Please ensure that your pull request works with the latest version of manim.**
You should also include:

1. The motivation for making this change (or link the relevant issues)
2. How you tested the new behavior (e.g. a minimal working example, before/after
screenshots, gifs, commands, etc.) This is rather informal at the moment, but
the goal is to show us how you know the pull request works as intended.
,2020-03-28T12:33:35Z,2020-03-28T12:33:35Z589400887,589400887,mvfs314,I'd like to run the code:
`numeros4 = TexMobject(
			"\\mathbb{N}",
			"=",
			"\\{",
			"1",
			",",
			"2",
			",",
			"3",
			",",
			"\\ldots",
			"\\}"
		)`
cause I wish I could change the color of the braces separately. But I got this error:
`Exception: Latex error converting to dvi.`
I've already tried using the command `Brace()` or the ideas found at reddit, but it didn't work at all. Is there a way to make it possible?

Thanks!,2020-03-27T20:38:59Z,2020-03-28T13:00:02Z605434438,589400887,Aathish04,Have you installed LaTeX? You also need quite a few LaTeX packages with it as well.
Please post the full traceback and we may be able to help you better.,2020-03-28T11:33:12Z,2020-03-28T11:33:12Z605440295,589400887,mvfs314,I certainly have. This is the basic LaTeX code, I just wanna write the braces separately.

Also, I've heard people saying that it isn't possible to write a single brace in LaTeX. You use Brace() for that, but you say you have tried that as well.

In any case, the contents of the log file would be mighty helpful.

You simply cannot use a single brace separately in LaTeX, and the way manim renders LaTeX (it uses \align a lot), the parser keeps thinking it is seeing a single brace.

For the time being, i suggest you use two Brace()es, which is tedious, but perhaps someone more experienced with LaTeX can help you out.

If you feel like probing the problem deeper, you can modify tex_template.tex, and see if you can get it to work.

It _does_ work when just writing to a file (-w). However, just for the shape examples. Anything with text doesn't work due to (unrelated) issues with dvisvgm not converting the dvi to svg.,2020-03-29T18:17:09Z,2020-03-29T18:17:09Z605678964,588606969,qo4on,What text doesn't work? `tex_mobject` or `text_mobject`?,2020-03-29T18:27:06Z,2020-03-29T18:27:06Z605719004,588606969,t-wolfeadam,> What text doesn't work? `tex_mobject` or `text_mobject`?

Both, unfortunately; I also tried modifying the example scenes with just using one or the other. Both result in `OSError: No file matching ./media\Tex\ab47de5016aed0d4.svg in image directory`.

I dug into it and it stems from the `dvisvgm` command (called from the `dvi_to_svg` function inside `\manimlib\utils\tex_file_writing.py`) - the command executes successfully but nothing gets outputted (no files or messages, even with the highest level of verbosity). I even tried searching my entire file system for the file and still nothing. It's really weird. 

I'm currently getting it setup to try on WSL. Hopefully that works better. No luck on googling the problem either. I'll probably open a new thread somewhere if it doesn't work with WSL :/

Edit: The problem with dvisvgm seems to be a Windows thing. I found out it's returning exit code -1073740791, which is apparently a stack buffer overflow. dvisvgm works fine on WSL, so for now I've implemented a hacky solution where Windows waits until Ubuntu has converted the necessary files. 

Edit 2: **Found the fix!** For future readers: Running `dvisvgm --version` reported 2.7. I ran `where dvisvgm` and it reported two versions: the v2.7 (installed in Program Files) showed before the other, which was part of MikTex and version 2.8.2. Removing the v2.7 copy fixed this issue. 
I am now able to render videos in this branch, as long as I'm writing to file (`w` flag) and not showing preview (`p` flag). ,2020-03-29T23:32:20Z,2020-03-30T17:18:35Z605728064,588606969,t-wolfeadam,Update: Ran into the same problems with the display. Tried using xvfb like so:

We do actually get it running in Google Colab with EGL, but it gets stuck in an infinite loop. That I think is a flow issue in the Manim code itself.. or at least it needs to be debugged properly to make a conclusion.

Manim is using moderngl and moderngl-window. I think the main issues is that it extends the pyglet window backend directly. If headless rendering is needed it should use the `headless.Window` instead.

The `BaseWindow.init_mgl_context` should be probably also be overridden to create the correct context type or I can add some features for this in the moderngl-window project if we figure out what is needed. Right now it tries to **detect** the context pyglet creates**, but in headless we just need to make our own context with no window (X11 or EGL).

It's not that complicated to fix thankfully.

I am willing to help out giving pointers for the moderngl specific things, but I don't really know much about Manim (at least yet).,2020-03-30T11:36:44Z,2020-03-30T11:57:16Z606115199,588606969,t-wolfeadam,> You can't get hardware acceleration with virtual displays such as xvfb.

Good to know! I can in Windows, but not in the Ubuntu subsystem. For both the `q` and `w` flags I get the `pyglet.canvas.xlib.NoSuchDisplayException: Cannot connect to "None"` exception.,2020-03-30T16:50:05Z,2020-03-30T16:50:05Z606136266,588606969,einarf,I released a new version of moderngl-window what should at least solve the `NoSuchConfig` for a lot of people. You maye also have to go into the `window.py` module and set `samples = 0`.

@t-wolfeadam The shader error you are getting is an error in the glsl code here : https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/2ce0b72c440fadbfba990bdac8bc9c2ea8bff4e7/manimlib/shaders/quadratic_bezier_fill_frag.glsl#L41

It should return a `float`, not an `int`. Not all GLSL compilers are nice and convert constants for you automatically. I would fix that line and test it again. Make a PR as well while you are at it (if it works) 😄 

You may see more of those, but they are quick and easy to fix if you search for the variable or function names reported by the GLSL compiler.

Credits: This .ova file was made by [Purusharth Saxena](https://github.com/purusharths),2020-03-26T11:17:33Z,2020-03-26T11:17:33Z587571726,587571726,Enempie,Hello everyone,
I'm pretty new to Python and neither had to set up different environments nor install a package (or something for it) outside of Anaconda or without the simple conda install <package> command.
As stated, I use Anaconda 3 and usually work with Spyder 4 on Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit. 
I somehow successfully installed the manim package and set up a manim environment by partially following a YT video and the instructions on this git. 
I have the following problems:
1. I can't setup a terminal in Spyder with my manim env. I guess Spyder can't find my virtualenv?
2. I can choose the manim env in VSCode and successfully render the example_scenes but only if I go to my manim directory from the terminal first which is okay but I don't know if that's the only way or if I set up something wrong (I'm not used to be forced to do that, is there a way to import manim and call the methods like I'm used to independent of the directory of my terminal)? I'm just a simple engineer and I honestly have no clue how complex software works in the background, I only know how to run my math stuff..As I said it's currently working (just from VSCode) but I'm wondering if it is possible to get it to my usual workflow (running the manim env in Spyder and especially calling manim methods without going to the directory with cd \.. commands first).
I'd appreciate a helping hand a lot and thanks a lot to this amazing community in advance.

Sincerely ,2020-03-25T09:51:01Z,2020-03-25T16:48:11Z603954587,587571726,Enempie,Okay, 
I managed to pin it down a bit. I got Anaconda to recognize my manim env and got it to the Spyder terminal. What's now still bothering me is, that I don't seem to be able to change directory in the IPython console of Spyder and therefore can't run the extraction. Again, it works perfectly in VSCode but I'd love to have the Spyder variable explorer for my purposes.
I'll post the console log asap. ,2020-03-25T16:48:11Z,2020-03-25T16:48:11Z585766275,585766275,Steff-san,I tried to install manin for linux but i get this error:

I am new to manim so please bear with me. I am trying to run older scenes and for them I am unable to run scenes which involve pi creatures. Is there a standard workaround for this?

In particular I get the following error:

    UserWarning: No PiCreatures design with mode plain (self.file_name_prefix, mode))

when running the following command from the manim directory:

    python manim.py from_3b1b/old/nn/part1.py -pl

As an example I chose scene number 28.

Any help would be appreciated. In case the images are not available I would be happy with a placeholder just to see and confirm that things work.,2020-03-19T16:53:54Z,2020-03-19T17:42:32Z601320562,584556456,Haffi112,I tried fixing it myself and noticed a couple of problems.

Image assets for creatures were missing. I found some [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fybvhyyr2mls40v/AABv9hQPuS_dJUhdKYdMJ3LWa/designs/PiCreature?dl=0&lst=&subfolder_nav_tracking=1) after reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Blue1Brown/comments/8v247s/i_have_been_inspired_by_3blue1brown_for_a_while/) Reddit thread. Note that these are not the standard creatures from the 3b1b youtube channel but it was never my goal to replicate that anyway.

The next hurdle is the MEDIA_DIR variable. It is by default set by the constants.py file but in the pi_creature.py file it shows up as an empty string. For the sake of making things work I decided to change it locally in the pi_creature.py file but I assume that is not the intended solution.

It would be great if there were some default assets to replace the normal pi_creatures and a fix for the above problem. Besides these issues I am really happy with manim ^^,2020-03-19T17:42:16Z,2020-03-19T17:42:32Z583833153,583833153,hanwenzhu,I worked on manim back in 2018. I added the function for using CTeX (XeLaTeX package for Chinese) and XeLaTeX instead of LaTeX using the flag `TEX_USE_CTEX` in constants.py (#315).

I have stopped working on manim since 2019, but over the months there are apparently more and more people who want to use LaTeX rendering in non-English languages, and even on very old issues I still occasionally see people asking how to do that... Looking back at my change I really should have **decoupled using CTeX (TeX template) from XeLaTeX (rendering tool)**. This has caused a *lot* of confusions and made weird hacks/fixes necessary for only using XeLaTeX, especially for a language that is not Chinese or English, with the most recent #858 and #840. It really should have been a flag `TEX_USE_XELATEX` and another flag `TEMPLATE_TEX_NAME`, and the flag `TEX_USE_CTEX` is such that when it is `True`, `TEX_USE_XELATEX` is `True` and `TEMPLATE_TEX_NAME` is `"ctex_template.tex"`; otherwise `TEX_USE_XELATEX` is `False` and `TEMPLATE_TEX_NAME` is `"tex_template.tex"`. Then set `TEMPLATE_TEX_FILE` to `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), TEMPLATE_TEX_NAME)`. Corresponding logic: constants.py lines 74–79.

It might be even better to set it dynamically using a function or as a parameter of `TexMobject()`, (see issues like #891). I looked at the source code and this is definitely possible. The options I can think of are
1. Use the current `TEX_USE_CTEX`
2. Add flags `TEX_USE_XELATEX` and `TEMPLATE_TEX_NAME`, and rework `TEX_USE_CTEX`
3. Add parameters for `TexMobject()` like `use_xelatex=False` and `tex_template="tex_template.tex"`
4. Use the flags of 2. as a default, and make it possible to change the default using 3.

Not really sure if this is the right place to raise this issue.

Also for future refrence it's better to attach a link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [hastebin](https://hastebin.com) with the relevant code and tracebacks instead of screenshots.,2020-03-18T06:42:13Z,2020-03-18T07:10:38Z600646029,583286873,luketimmerman314,So how would I remedy this situation?

Both of those names are defined already at the top of the file so it's as simple as replacing the undefined name with either one of those.

Also for getting started with Python I'd recommend the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) or the [realpython blog](https://realpython.com/) and for asking questions there's [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/), one of the [many](https://discordapp.com/invite/python) [discord](https://discord.gg/RAKc3HF) [guilds](https://discordapp.com/invite/code) or the #python channel on the [freenode IRC](https://freenode.net/).

But it still says 
OSError: No file matching assets/PsiCreatures_happy.svg in image directory

Does this have something to do with where I have placed the svg file? Currently, I have placed the svg file in manim/manimlib/files, as this is where the PiCreatures_plain.svg also resides. I tried moving the svg to the assets file to see if that would work, but it still returns the same error message. Any advice for this?,2020-03-18T19:46:47Z,2020-03-18T19:46:47Z600948199,583286873,hanwenzhu,`FILE_DIR` was defined way back to be os.path.join(".", "files") and is removed in commit caa4577cd161e5c8bd4f2f57b9d6c3295672d2a3. Add this line to the top of your script
```py
FILE_DIR = os.path.join(".", "files")
```
after the `import *` if your SVG files are placed in ./files

It seems that the FILE_DIR reference is part of the error handling block. Check if the SVG files are in ./media/assets or ./assets first,2020-03-19T02:05:36Z,2020-03-19T02:13:26Z600960816,583286873,luketimmerman314,Ok, so I moved the file PsiCreatures_happy.svg back to the files folder in the library and then added the code you provided. However, it is still giving me this error when I am trying to run it in Terminal:

Any ideas? Does it have something to do with the fact that it is trying to work with the assets folder? Because this folder is no longer where those svg images are stored.

That got it to play, but now there is a different issue: it looks nothing like the image that I made using the InkScape program. Any suggestions on how to fix that? I tried using it with Grant's Pi Creatures, and that worked perfectly, so it must be something with my file or code, maybe?

Thanks!,2020-03-19T04:15:45Z,2020-03-19T04:15:45Z600989330,583286873,hanwenzhu,I'm not sure, but my guess is that it's manim's problem working with SVG files, since if I remember correctly manim uses its own SVG parsing code. This works fine on LaTeX-generated SVG but most likely not on any SVG.,2020-03-19T04:59:29Z,2020-03-19T05:02:36Z600994069,583286873,luketimmerman314,Ok thanks for the clarification. Is there somewhere you could point me that would show me how to generate my svg file using LaTex? Or perhaps somehow convert my .svg to be compatible with the manim code?

Thanks again for all of your help! I really appreciate it!,2020-03-19T05:20:46Z,2020-03-19T05:20:46Z601005602,583286873,hanwenzhu,The .tex file generates a .dvi file using the `latex` command, which is used to generate the .svg file using `dvisvgm`. This is in [tex_file_writing.py](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/manimlib/utils/tex_file_writing.py). The SVG parsing part is at the definition of SVGMobject [here](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/manimlib/mobject/svg/svg_mobject.py#L76). It only handles `<defs>`, `<g>/<svg>/<symbol>`, `<path>`, `<use>`, `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, and `<polygon>/<polyline>`.,2020-03-19T06:08:38Z,2020-03-19T06:08:38Z601012984,583286873,luketimmerman314,All that my PsiCreature is built from are paths and ellipses, so I'm not sure if that's the problem. So I found the image that Grant uses (PiCreatures_plain.svg) and opened it with just the standard TextEdit Program. It looks as if Grant used Adobe Illustrator to construct the image, and then used an SVG Export plug In to export the file. Do you think that if I rebuilt the image using Illustrator instead of InkScape that it would render correctly? For reference, I have attached the code I received from PiCreatures_plain.svg

**Please ensure that your pull request works with the latest version of manim.**
You should also include:

1. The motivation for making this change (or link the relevant issues)

I changed the color of the GraphScene axis but could not change the color of the tick labels to match.  This is a small change to graph_scene.py to provide the correct information to NumberLine.

2. How you tested the new behavior (e.g. a minimal working example, before/after
screenshots, gifs, commands, etc.) This is rather informal at the moment, but
the goal is to show us how you know the pull request works as intended.

I have no coding experience with this kind of thing so I am coming to y'all for help. I have attached screen shots of all of the code that my Terminal spit back out at me (it is a lot of screen shots, and I know that y'all don't need all of them, but I don't have the experience to know what y'all do and do not need). A little background: I successfully got through Step 6 of the walkthrough and am currently working in a virtual environment. I believe I successfully installed sox, FFmpeg, latex, and pycairo. I then got the error message when trying to install the requirements.txt program. To try and fix the problem, I tried upgrading pip, changing the version of opencv-python in the requirements.txt file from 3.4.2.17 to 4.2.0.32, and finally changed the Pillow from 5.2.0 in the same document to 6.2.0, but I ended up downloading version 7.0.0. Thanks in advance.

It might be worth trying to install Manim's dependencies without worrying about their versions.
First, activate your Virtual Environment.
Then, remove all previously installed packages, so we have a clean slate to work with.

`pip3 uninstall -y $(pip3 freeze)`

Now, copy and run this pip command, which basically just installs all of Manim's dependencies, without giving a damn about their versions.

`pip3 install colour data decorator ffmpeg funcsigs future latex numpy opencv-python Pillow progressbar pycairo pydub scipy shutilwhich six sox tempdir tqdm`

See if all that works fine. It _should_, but if it doesn't, this might explain why:

> **Update 02/19/20: This post is a little bit out of date with the current Manim library. For additional resources, please see https://repperiumsci.blogspot.com/2019/12/my-adventures-with-manim-part_22.html for additional ways to get Manim working on your computer.  Additionally, I have uploaded the version of Manim (09/18) pertinent to this this tutorial on GitHub. This should have been a fork, but it is what it is…**
-From his site

So maybe check out https://repperiumsci.blogspot.com/2019/12/my-adventures-with-manim-part_22.html and see if the instructions there work out.,2020-03-14T17:56:55Z,2020-03-14T17:56:55Z579660639,579660639,ddxtanx,This is a merging of two pull requests to add better discontinuity detecting functionality and implicit function graphing capabilities in requests #832 and #839. I don't think it would serve much to repeat the rationale and testing again in another PR, so the relevant information is in the separate pull requests. If, however, it would be more conducive to reviewers to include such information here I would be happy to transfer it all over here.

You can add element "tv_title" in meow_navigation_cell.xml layout like code below:
![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5845119/74512996-1bb99280-4f3c-11ea-9f38-e94ef408339a.PNG)

And in class MeowBottomNavigation. You add a param "title: String" to model constructor and update logic like "count" param. Finally, in "animateProgress" method you add:
`tv_title?.visibility = if (enableCell) View.GONE else View.VISIBLE`

Hope this help!,2020-02-14T08:17:05Z,2020-02-14T08:20:43Z586150583,416683839,tungds,@oneHamidreza I can add text below icon but when menu selected the text position follow to icon.
